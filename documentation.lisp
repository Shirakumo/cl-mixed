                       of three floats.

                       listener. Value should be a list
                       of three floats.

  :SOUNDSPEED      --- The speed of sound in the medium.
                       Default is 34330, meaning \"1\" is
                       measured as 1cm.
  :DOPPLER-FACTOR  --- This can be used to over- or
                       understate the effect of the
                       doppler. Default is 1.0.
  :MIN-DISTANCE    --- The minimal distance under which
                       the source has reached max volume.
  :MAX-DISTANCE    --- The maximal distance over which
                       the source is completely inaudible.
  :ROLLOFF         --- The rolloff factor describing the
                       curvature of the attenuation
                       function.
  :ATTENUATION     --- The attenuation function describing
