This is the Secret Rabbit Code / libsamplerate library source code version 0.1.9 obtained from <http://www.mega-nerd.com/SRC/>

It has been adapted to be configure-free and thus integrate better with libmixed's build system. No files have been changed, only a sample `config.h` file has been added that should work on libmixed's target platforms, and of course this `README.md` and the `LICENSE` copy.
